# Challenge-Pokemon-PHP
For my training at BeCode, I rewrote a Pokedex a classmember and I coded originally in Javascript, to PHP.

## Learning objectives
* Starting with PHP
    * To be able to write a simple condition and a simple loop
    * To know how to access external resources (API)
* To know where to search for PHP documentation
* To find out how much easier it is to learn a second programming language

## The Mission
Remember the Pokemon challenge we had to do in Javascript? For this exercise we had to re-create that challenge in PHP!

One of the goals was to show us how easy it is to pick a new language, once you know your first programming language (Javascript in my case).

## The Result
As you can see on the picture below, it looks exactly like the pokedex looked before when we wrote in Javascript. However, the code behind it, now looks way cleaner. So I would say the result is pretty succesful and on top of that I already feel like PHP and I are going to be the best of friends.
